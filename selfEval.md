# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

> I feel fairly confident with the six we've learned so far. I'm glad we were working mostly with numbers as the math aspect of the symbols was translatable I think but, how they will apply to words or variable inputs from a user or something I think that will be a whole other can of worms I'll have to figure out lol.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

> Same as above. I feel like I've gotten a good grasp on what they are doing but I know the scope of applications is probably so much more than I realize! I do like figuring out if I need an 'or' or an 'and' with some of my code though.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

> Well I'm not going to lie, the if statement stuff kicked my a** but, after the exercises we've done I feel like a 3 out of 5 maybe. Trying to understand how to plug in my conditionals and how where to put my "and"s and "or"s was particularly difficult but I think I could think my way through some stuff if I had enough time lol.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

> probably a cumulative total of 3 hrs including class time. I went over my estimation but, I think that is because I'm still at the start so I still don't know exactly how to phrase questions or searches and I don't know enough to know what I don't know so; I think the more exposure I get the better I'll be able to do that.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

> I think I need to go back and run through all the mod 0 stuff and prolly see if I can find a YT crash course on terminal navigation/operation and posibly a basics on data architecture or something. like, I may not know the layout of every city but if I understand how to read a map I can get approximate locations alot faster than I would've otherwise. The map in this case being the basics of the industry I suppose lol.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

> How to find a list of the possible commands in all these programs lol. I will continue to do my own research and just continue to learn man, all I can do I believe. That and take good notes lol.
