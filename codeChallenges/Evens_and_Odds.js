/** The remainder (%) operator returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand.
 * It always takes the sign of the dividend. In my own words I believe this is saying that two numbers (in this case) fit equally into this
 * other number. When they don't, it's simply saying, 'hey, there's extra number left over, over here'.
 * Syntax (x % y)
